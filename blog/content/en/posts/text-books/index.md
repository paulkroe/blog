It seems clich√© to have a list of textbooks on your blog, but I hope to give this list an extra spin. When I switched gears from mathematics to computer science, I had much to catch up on, but I did not want to spend any money on textbooks. Luckily, there are a lot of great resources out there that are free to use. Here are some freely available textbooks and lecture videos that I found helpful. In case you are wondering: No, I have not read all the books front to back.
