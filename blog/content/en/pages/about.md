I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Columbia University, New York, following my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at ETH Zürich.

I am deeply curious and constantly seeking to expand my knowledge across various topics in Statistics and Computer Science. I advocate for first principles thinking, striving to thoroughly understand the intricacies of each subject I explore. Conversation is a vital tool for this kind of learning, and I’m always open to engaging discussions. Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn — hopefully we can grab a coffee.
